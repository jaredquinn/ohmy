Python wrapper for MySQLdb to make it bareable while still being lightweight and flexible.


This is a work in progress;   I became frustrated with MySQLdb and began wrapping it's
functions in another project; and extended it for the functionality I required.  

Better error checking needs to be implemented and more useful results and exceptions.

Feel free to fork it and make it more complete if you find it useful!
